# rrailkar-MS-Error-Ellipse-tool

In order to quantify uncertainty in the estimated kinetic parameters, by fitting catalytic data to Langmuir-Hinshelwood and other subsurface diffusion models, the method of plotting error ellipses was employed. Error ellipses give an estimate of the covariance between parameters and the confidence limit with which one can state the parameter value. 

The code in the Python notebook shows a demo problem for trying the error ellipses.
